        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p><strong>Japanese jiggly cheesecake</strong> (souffle style cheesecake, cotton cheesecake) has a characteristically wobbly, airy texture similar to a souffle when fresh out of the oven and a chiffon cake-like texture when chilled.</p>
        <p>The recipe was created by Japanese chef Tomotaro Kuzuno who was inspired by <em>kasekuchen cheesecake</em> (a German variant) during a trip to Berlin in the 1960s. It is less sweet and has fewer calories than standard Western-style cheesecakes, containing less cheese and sugar. It is a crustless cheesecake and traditionally made in a <em>bain-marie</em> (water bath) similar to most baked cheesecakes.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>180 g (3/4 cups) Cream cheese Philadelphia</li>
            <li>30 g (2 tablespoons) Unsalted butter</li>
            <li>50 g (1/5 cups) Whole milk</li>
            <li>35 g (1/3 cups) Pastry flour Ideally use low protein content flour. Can be substituted with all purpose flour</li>
            <li>10 g (1 1/4 tablespoon) Corn starch</li>
            <li>Pinch of salt</li>
            <li>75 g Egg yolk yolk of approx 4 eggs</li>
            <li>125 g Egg white white of approx 4 eggs</li>
            <li>50 g (1/4 cups) Superfine sugar</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Start with preparing a 15 cm (6 inch) round cake pan with parchment paper and pre-heating the oven with a water bath in it</li>
            <li>Pulse blend granulated sugar to superfine sugar then measure</li>
            <li>Heat cream cheese, butter, and milk in a saucepan on low heat until completely smooth. Remove it from the heat</li>
            <li>Mix egg yolks into the cream cheese mixture, one at a time, mixing after each addition</li>
            <li>Sift dry ingredients (cornstarch, salt and flour) and fold into the cream cheese-egg yolk mixture. Fold until mixture well combined and without any lumps</li>
            <li>Whip egg whites starting on low speed on your Stand mixer or with an Electric hand mixer </li>
            <li>Start adding one tablespoon superfine sugar at a time really slowly while increase the speed of your mixer. Once all the sugar in, whip for a few more minutes until soft peaks form and the sugar completely dissolves. <strong>Remember, do not overbeat to stiff peaks</strong>, check the consistency of the meringue regularly to avoid over beating</li>
            <li>With the help of a Rubber spatula gently fold the meringue into the rest of the ingredients. The batter should stay fluffy</li>
            <li>Pour batter into the prepared 15 cm (6 inch) round cake pan</li>
            <li>Bake the cheesecake in the water bath at 150C / 302F (no fan) for 30min then lower temp to 110C / 230F (no fan) and bake for another 60min. Make sure your oven is at the right temp by using a Digital oven thermometer</li>
            <li>Once the cheesecake is nicely baked; remove it from the oven, flip it over with the help of a plate, then flip it back with the help of another plate</li>
            <li>Enjoy while it is warm and jiggly, or serve it chilled withing 1-2 days</li>
            <li>Store in the fridge</li>
        </ol>
