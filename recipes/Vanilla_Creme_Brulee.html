        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Five simple ingredients: cream, vanilla, salt, eggs and sugar - combined make for an exquisitely rich and elegant dessert.</p>
        <p>Most creme brulee recipes require the use of a small <em>propane torch</em> to achieve the crackly sugar top, but this version offers a simpler (and safer) solution: your <em>oven's broiler</em>. One thing to note: Be sure to let the custard set for <strong>several hours</strong> in the refrigerator before bruleeing the top, otherwise you'll end up with soupy custard.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups heavy or light cream (or half-and-half)</li>
            <li>1 vanilla bean, split lengthwise, or 1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1/8 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>5 egg yolks</li>
            <li>1/2 cup granulated sugar, plus more for topping</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat oven to 325 degrees. In a saucepan, combine cream, vanilla bean and salt; cook over low heat just until hot. Let sit for a few minutes, then discard vanilla bean. (If using vanilla extract, add it now.)</li>
            <li>In a bowl, beat yolks and sugar together until light. Stir about a quarter of the vanilla cream into this mixture, then pour sugar-egg mixture into cream and stir. Pour into four 6-ounce ramekins and place ramekins in a baking dish; fill dish with boiling water halfway up the sides of the ramekins.</li>
            <li>Bake for 30 to 40 minutes, or until centers are barely set. Cool completely. Refrigerate for several hours and up to a couple of days.</li>
            <li>When ready to serve, top each custard with about a teaspoon of sugar in a thin layer.</li>
            <li>Place ramekins in a broiler 2 to 3 inches from heat source. Turn on broiler. Cook until sugar melts and browns or even blackens a bit, about 5 minutes. Serve within 2 hours.</li>
        </ol>
